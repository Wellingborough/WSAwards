# WSAwards
Template for HTML pages to be used in WS Awards implementation

This project is being used to experiment with HTML mail formats only.

The processing part of the project is on the home office computer as "departmentPostcards" in the PyCharmProjects folder.

I have uploaded a copy here for safety. but it needs to be updated - I completed the HTML generation and made some other minor changes post the first upload.
